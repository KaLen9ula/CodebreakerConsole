          1.Codebreaker is a logic game in which a code-breaker tries to break a secret code\n
          created by a code-maker. The codemaker, which will be played by the application weâ€™re\n
          going to write, creates a secret code of four numbers between %{code_range_first} and %{code_range_last}.\n
          2.The codebreaker gets some number of chances to break the code (depends on chosen\n
          difficulty). In each turn, the codebreaker makes a guess of %{code_length} numbers. The codemaker\n
          then marks the guess with up to %{code_length} signs - + or - or empty spaces.\n
          3.A + indicates an exact match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the\n
          numbers in the secret code and in the same position. For example:\n
          Secret number - 1234\n
          Input number - 6264\n
          Number of pluses - 2 (second and fourth position)\n
          4.A - indicates a number match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the\n
          numbers in the secret code but in a different position. For example:\n
          Secret number - 1234\n
          Input number - 6462\n
          Number of minuses - 2 (second and fourth position)\n
          5.An empty space indicates that there is not a current digit in a secret number.\n
          6.If codebreaker inputs the exact number as a secret number - codebreaker wins the\n
          game. If all attempts are spent - codebreaker loses.\n
          7.Codebreaker also has some number of hints(depends on chosen difficulty). If a user takes\n
          a hint - he receives back a separate digit of the secret code.\n"
